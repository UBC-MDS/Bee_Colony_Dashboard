## Motivation and purpose

## Description of the data

## Research questions and usage scenarios

The Bee Colony Dashboard helps identify bee colony losses over quarterly
periods in the US. The geographic map visual illustrates how bee colony
losses vary over each state for a single period in time, and
apiarists/beekeepers can gain an idea of the local severity of colony
stressors in different states. The time series plot visualizes the
number of colonies over time for a single state and will inform
apiarists/beekeepers of how problems affecting colonies
increase/decrease over time. The third visualization, the stacked bar
chart of stressors, gives insight on what specific problems a certain
stateâ€™s colonies face over time, and can provide crucial information on
what stressors need to be combated to improve colony health.

Below is a usage scenario of our dashboard:

Buzzing Bee is a beekeeping company interested in researching about the
colony loss across US.Since the loss rates are high the beekeepers are
under pressure to create new colonies to offset losses each year. The
company apiarists wants to work with agriculture practitioners and farms
to keep the bee colonies stable without the need to adding new colonies
each year.
