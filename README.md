## What are we doing?

### The problem

During the winter of 2006-2007, some beekeepers in America began to report unusually high losses of 30-90 percent of their hives. Bees are one of the most essential components of modern agriculture as a wide variety of flowering plants, including apples and blueberries, require managed pollinators such as bees to ensure continued production. Colony loss has declined since then but is still a concern as bees are vital to the natural ecosystem and our food systems.

### The solution

Easy access to data on declining colony health is therefore necessary to maintaining natural ecosystems and food systems. In particular our dashboard will allow users to visualize and explore the number of colonies, the loss trend, and colony stressors over time in different localities of the United States.
