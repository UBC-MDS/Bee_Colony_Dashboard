# Group 9  Team Contract Document 
## Expectations
All members are expected to contribute equally to all aspects of the project including but not limited to code, writing and project management. It is expected that each group member will fork the repository to their personal GitHub.com account and work there, and then send pull-requests of their work to the upstream repo. The rest of the team will then review, critique and finally accept each individual team memberâ€™s pull request.
The time expected for group members to work on DSCI 532 will be a maximum of 6 hours unless all the team members agree that more time is needed to complete the assigned tasks. If team members cannot complete their assigned tasks within the maximum hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the group submission date (Saturday 6pm) to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
All team members are expected to contribute work that is of high quality, and all team submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.
## Meetings
Regular meetings will be held in person or online via zoom / slack on the following dates. Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed.
- Tuesdays: 2-4 pm (formal lab period)
- Thursday: 8-9 pm
All members are expected to attend all meetings. If a member cannot make it to a meeting, they must provide adequate notice of at least 4 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options.
## Communication
All communication will be through meetings or via Slack or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.
## Peer Review
All team members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate.
## Deadlines
Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. Items will typically be informally due on Fridays, in order to leave time for work to be peer reviewed on Saturday ahead of the formal milestone deadlines. As a team we will then ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.
## Breach of Contract
Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
1. The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract is required by the member.
3. The third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate
